# OldSchoolQuestHelperApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.4.

This is a pet project for me to learn Angular, as well as a much needed tool to aid in finding quests I'm eligible for in Old School Runescape.
While an API and quest tool exists for RS3, Old School does not have any such tool.

The dirty solution is parsing HTML DOMs from the RS3 Wiki to obtain quest data. While not optimal, it's the best I got.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
